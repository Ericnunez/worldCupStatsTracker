# worldCupStatsTracker
A java application that can track match statistics for the FIFA world cup. Uses mySQL.

## About
This is a text based program built with Java 8 and uses SQL as the database language as well as mySQL server.
Realistically this program can track any type of sporting event and can be modified to track custom statistics.
A sql file for building the schema is provided but can also be customized further.

I do plan on making a GUI for this program later and expanding the method offerings.
